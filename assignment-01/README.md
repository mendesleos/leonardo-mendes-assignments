# ðŸŽ“ Assignment: Understanding Context Engineering and Specification-Driven Development (SDD)

## Overview

This assignment guides you to explore **Context Engineering (vibe-coding)** and **Specification-Driven Development (SDD)**, two cutting-edge methodologies in AI-assisted coding.
You will study resources, research unfamiliar terms, prepare a **GitHub starter repository**, and create a **Gemini Canvas webpage** that connects both concepts.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:

* Define and explain **context engineering** (vibe-coding).
* Define and explain **Specification-Driven Development (SDD)**.
* Research and explain additional related terms (see list below).
* Apply SDD by scaffolding a **GitHub repository**.
* Show the relationship between context engineering and SDD in a **Gemini Canvas webpage**.
* Present your findings in a **live Google Meet session**.

---

## Materials

1. ðŸŽ¥ **Video**: [Spec Kit: Github's NEW tool That FINALLY Fixes AI Coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=em3vIT9aUsg)
2. ðŸ“„ **Document**: [Specification-Driven Development (SDD)](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/blob/main/spec-driven.md)

---

## Tasks

### 1. Initial Review & Note-Taking

* Watch the video and read the document once, without interruptions.
* Write down **all terms you donâ€™t know or only vaguely know**.

### 2. Research Phase

Research the unfamiliar terms using **Gemini normal mode**, and use **Gemini deep research** if needed.
At minimum, you must research the following terms:

* **PRD (Product Requirements Document / Specification)**
* **API**
* **REST / RESTful API** (basic concepts only)

Summarize your findings in your own words.

### 3. Core Explanations

Prepare clear explanations of:

* **Context Engineering (Vibe-Coding)**
* **Specification-Driven Development (SDD)**

### 4. GitHub Repository Starter Project

You will create a **starter repository** (initially as a folder on your PC) to demonstrate SDD in practice.

#### Folder & File Tree (with placeholder content)

```bash
my-sdd-project/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   # Project Overview
â”‚   # Explain purpose: following SDD methodology
â”‚   # Instructions: how specs drive development
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”‚   # Ignore files like node_modules/, .env, etc.
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ spec/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ user_auth.spec.md
â”‚   â”‚   # Example specification file
â”‚   â”‚   # Title: User Authentication
â”‚   â”‚   # Context: System must allow users to sign up, log in, log out
â”‚   â”‚   # Requirements:
â”‚   â”‚   #  - User can create account with email & password
â”‚   â”‚   #  - User can log in with valid credentials
â”‚   â”‚   #  - System rejects invalid login attempts
â”‚   â”‚   #  - User can log out successfully
â”‚   â”‚   # Notes: To be refined iteratively
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”‚       # Folder explaining the role of specifications
â”‚       # Specs define system behavior before coding
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ placeholder.txt
â”‚       # This is where source code will go
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ user_auth.test.js
â”‚       // Placeholder test file
â”‚       // Example: assert login requires valid credentials
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ docs/
    â””â”€â”€ architecture.md
        # Optional space for design notes, diagrams, API sketches
```

ðŸ‘‰ At this stage, files can contain **comments and placeholder text**. The key is to show the **structure that a coding agent would follow using SDD**.

### 5. Gemini Canvas Webpage

Build a **Gemini Canvas webpage** with the following outline:

#### Suggested Structure

**Title:** *From Context Engineering to Specification-Driven Development*

1. **Introduction**

   * Why AI-assisted methodologies matter.

2. **Context Engineering (Vibe-Coding)**

   * Definition & role.
   * Diagram: *Prompt â†’ Context Setup â†’ AI Behavior*.

3. **Specification-Driven Development (SDD)**

   * Definition & workflow.
   * Diagram: *Spec â†’ AI Agent â†’ Code + Tests â†’ Review â†’ Update Spec*.

4. **How They Connect**

   * Context = guides AI behavior.
   * Specs = provide structured goals.
   * Diagram: *Intersection of Context + Spec = Effective AI Coding*.

5. **Practical Example**

   * Reference your `user_auth.spec.md`.
   * Show how an AI agent could use it to generate code.

6. **Conclusion**

   * Benefits of combining both.
   * Future outlook.

## Deliverables

1. **Notes & Research Summaries** (all unfamiliar terms, plus PRD, API, REST/RESTful).
2. **Core Explanations** (context engineering + SDD).
3. **GitHub Repository Starter Project** (scaffolded structure with placeholder content).
4. **Gemini Canvas Webpage** (clear, visual explanation of both concepts).
5. **Live Presentation**

   * **Google Meet** on **Friday, 15:00 PM**
   * 10 minutes presentation + 5 minutes Q\&A

---

## Evaluation Criteria

* **Clarity of Explanation**: Are context engineering and SDD explained well?
* **Depth of Research**: Are the new terms (PRD, API, REST) explained correctly?
* **Technical Application**: GitHub repo follows SDD scaffolding.
* **Integration & Critical Thinking**: Canvas shows the relationship effectively.
* **Presentation**: Clear, structured, and engaging.
